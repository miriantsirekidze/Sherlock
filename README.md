Sherlock is a React Native reverse image search proxy. Upload an image and Sherlock makes it publicly accessible so you can query multiple search engines—Google Images, Lens, Yandex, TinEye, Bing, Trace, CopySeeker, Mever, Picarta, and PimEyes—in one place. Sherlock also includes:

- **Filtering for Google Images**  
  Narrow your results by size, color, type, time, and usage rights before launching a query.

- **Articles & Use Cases**  
  Read concise write-ups about each supported engine (when to use Yandex over TinEye, pros and cons of PimEyes, etc.) and discover creative workflows (verifying news photos, finding high-resolution product images, conducting color-based searches).

- **Default Engine Selection**  
  Choose your preferred search engine in Settings so Sherlock uses it automatically for one-tap searches.

- **Bookmarking**  
  Save and organize URLs returned by any engine. Access your bookmarked links later without having to re-search.
